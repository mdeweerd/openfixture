# Pin 3D Models

Most Pogo Pin models are generated using the `pogopins.scad` and `create-steps.sh` scripts.
At this time they are not compared to physical pins.


There are other 3D Models available on the Web that are not provided in this repository.
They can be downloaded from the following sources and are subject to their respective licences.

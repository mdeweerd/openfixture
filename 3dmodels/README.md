# Pin 3D Models

Most Pogo Pin models are generated using the `create-steps.sh` script that calls upon the `pogopins.scad` script.
At this time they are not verified against physical pins so measures may be incorrect.

There are other 3D Models available on the Web that are not provided in this repository.
They can be downloaded from the following sources and are subject to their respective licences.

# TODO

- Add more pin heads;
- Also generate "compressed" versions of the PIN Models (i.e., versions where the pin extends less from the socket because it is compressed against a board).
